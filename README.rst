Personal Software Process (PSP)
===============================
The main objective of these programs is to learn the good practices of PSP.

These are the 7 PSP programs that come as a case study for students to learn
how to work with the `Process Dashboard`.

To execute each of the programs and print the result in the console, you must
create an instance of the main class that comes in each program.

It is that the programs are in the same directory so that everything works
in an integrated manner.

In the `Install` folder come the installers for Linux and Windows of the
Process Dashboard software. f you are a student, I recommend installing the
java executable for students.

Note: The `pdash_all_programs ... zip` file already contains the activities and
flaws of the seven programs.
